# Opioid_DataDive
This data dive explores possible causes and correlations related to the opioid epidemic.

Edit 1: 

  With the current data there doesn't seem to be a strong correlation with anything besides median income and state proportion with a bachelors. Grouping the counties into states and states into regions lessons the chances of correlations. I think further data is needed to find possible factors. Originally, I hypothesisized that states with a higher median income would have less of an opioid related crisis. There seems to be supporting evidence of that if you look at the Milligram of Morphine equivalent prescription (MME), Rate, and median income. States and regions with a lower MME tend to have higher median incomes. However, before building the model, we can't tell if this is statistically significant or not. 
  
  
Something worth noting is the the substantial growth of opioid prescriptions from 1991 to 2013. The total prescription nearly tripled! I would like to find an explanation for that outside of the data. I think the last couple years on that graph are the first to be lower than the previous year because that's areound the time that fentynal hit the market. Perhaps seeing the impact synthetic opioids have on people caused this minute decrease? 

Overall, further data is needed if we are to find reasoning behind the opioid epidemic.
