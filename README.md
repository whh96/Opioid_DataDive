# Opioid_DataDive
This data dive explores possible causes and correlations related to the opioid epidemic.

Edit: 

  With the current data there doesn't seem to be a strong correlation with anything besides median income and state proportion with a bachelors. Grouping the counties into states and states into regions lessons the chances of correlations. I think further data is needed to find possible factors. Originally, I hypothesisizes that states with a higher median income would have less of an opioid related crisis. There seems to be supporting evidence of that if you look at the Milligram of Morphine equivalent prescription (MME). States and regions with a lower MME tend to have higher median incomes. However, before building the model, we can't tell if this is statistically significant.
